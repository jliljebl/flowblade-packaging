<h3>Main points</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sync relations are set up by selecting a <b>Sync Parent Clip</b> for a <b>Sync Child Clip</b>.</li>
<li><b>Only clips on track V1 can be Sync Parent Clips</b>. This is done to encourage edit style in which the main body of the Sequence is on track V1 and composites and audio split edits are done relative to the clip sequence on track V1.</li>
<li><b>Sync feature helps preserve earlier work</b> an multitrack composites and audio split edits when clips are no longer in correct positions relative to each other, because of edits elsewhere on the Sequence.</li>
<li><b>Resyncs are only done on request</b> to avoid jumping of clips on the timeline while editing. Explicit resyncs are also better from the point of view of avoiding side effects when doing edits.
