So I need to build the final apppiamge on virtualbox Ubuntu 14.04? The whole idea is to piggypack installations on distributions?

Let's just build one on my 16.10.

Where I can get apprun file template? (ggogle gives aungularJS)

Can I autogerate apprun file?

- Oh you can download it,functions.sh...I somehow by luck received information on functions.sh

I can't use functions.sh raw?

How can I run Flowblade.yml?

https://github.com/probonopd/AppImageKit/wiki/Creating-AppImages is not very good


"Create a working AppDir from your binaries. A working AppImage runs your app when you execute its AppRun file." - that fucking helpful....HOW?

Let's try using stuff from functions.sh.....

get_apprun creates run binary file? AppRun is the Appimage special sauce I'm not supposed to create my own?

So functions.sh finds .desktop file and icon if Flowblade installed in system I can just cpopy them too, from my own files.

get_icon function isn't working: "ls: cannot access '.png': No such file or directory"??? Maybe ... I don't know... I need to set and export $LOWERAPP value

export worked "ls: cannot access 'flowblade.png':" but still didn't find it

I will need to just use my own file.

How about getting dependecies like python-dbus

"Convert existing binary packages. This option migh..." THE FUCKING THING DOESN'T TELL HOW??? how do I go from Flowblade.yml to an AppImage

Oh, there is some AppImageKit...how about linking to that from "Convert existing binary packages. This option migh...".


And what the FUCK is Travis-CI? Do I need to join to Travis-CI to build appimages?

"Gather suitable binaries of all dependencies..." How the fuck do I do that...real simple.


...now I'm downloading binaries AppDir Assistant from AppImage Assistant from SourceForge...fucking adds

...running them does nothing

...I'm giving up for now


-------------------------------------------- SESSION 2
Got some info from AppImage people. the magic words to get rolling are:

wget "https://github.com/probonopd/AppImages/raw/master/recipes/meta/Recipe"
bash -ex Recipe Flowblade

So Recipe is sameish as snapcraft, it takes XXX.yml data as input and builds the Appimage.

...and an Appimage was created, hooray.

--------------------------------------- SESSION 3
So there are is no docs radily available on creating recipes, I have to see if any exist all, all i have seen so far examples.

..So how can I add my own binaries into appimage, just copy them???

Yes, probonopd aswered:

"""
Absolutely, yes. After running the yml, you will see a Flowblade/Flowblade.AppDir directory. Just edit the contents of this directory as you like, then from the Flowblade directory, run ./appimagetool ./Flowblade.AppDir
"""

...lets make script to copy libs and see 

...I created a script that replaces binaries .AppDir with binaries compiled by Dan's script and then running the build command loads the old binarise from .debs...uh.


--------------------------------------- SESSION 4
Maybe removing debs from Flowblade folder will packagege without them...or maybe there is a switch that builds without unpacking debs


--------------------------------------- SESSION 5, 6, 7
..okay so 'Recipe' file was broekn on Appimage repoditory but an older one worked
...and the whole approach worked, now I have booting AppImage on Ubuntu 16.10 with MLT 6.4.1
...now to nake one one Ubuntu 14.04
